Nozzle Project <br />
-Project information: Design a nozzle and mount to hold it. Determine angle to position nozzle for the stream of water to reach max height and max distance. <br />
-NozzleCalculator.cpp is a file I wrote to calculate the distance water exiting the nozzle would travel based on the height of the nozzle and the angle it is placed.
